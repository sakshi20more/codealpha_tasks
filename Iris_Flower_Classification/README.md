# Iris Flower Classification

## Objective
The objective of this task is to build a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into different species based on their physical measurements.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (Target variable)

The cleaned dataset is stored in the `cleaned_dataset` folder in CSV format.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

---

## Methodology
1. Imported required Python libraries  
2. Loaded and explored the dataset  
3. Performed data preprocessing and cleaning  
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
5. Trained a machine learning classification model  
6. Evaluated the model using accuracy and performance metrics  

---

## Results
- The model successfully classified iris flower species.
- Accuracy and evaluation metrics are displayed in the notebook/output.
